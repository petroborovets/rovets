Мені завжди було цікаво завести сайтик на якому можна буде документувати щось корисне для себе і фіксувати враження життєвих подій, щоб потім можна було із ностальгією згадувати старі історії.",

        "headingText": "React, sometimes referred to as a frontend JavaScript framework, but actually is a free, open-source FE library created by Facebook. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. Library can be utilized to build single-page applications, mobile apps, or server-rendered apps with frameworks such as Next.js. Since React focuses solely on the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, applications built with React often depend on additional libraries for routing and other client-side functionalities.",
