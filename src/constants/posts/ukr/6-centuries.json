    "headingText": "The century ride. That grand, mythical beast of the cycling world, where pedal meets pavement for a grueling 100 kilometers (or 100 miles if you’re from a land where kilometers fear to tread). Whether it’s on winding roads in metric countries or sprawling miles in imperial lands, it’s a right of passage, an ode to endurance. Organized by cycling clubs, these events draw us in with the promise of camaraderie, self-doubt, and probably the finest post-ride snacks you’ll ever encounter. Some clubs even make it an annual affair - a social gathering, a fundraiser, a chance to test one’s mettle against the clock, the road, and their own excuses.",
    "headingSubText": "The origins of the century ride are as murky as a foggy mountain pass, though whispers suggest it first surfaced in the United States, circa 1890. That was when cycling was the latest craze - before smartphones, selfies, and riding for “the ‘Gram.” Back then, the goal wasn’t just to cover a distance, but to prove something: you had the endurance, the fitness, and maybe just enough madness to ride for hours on end. Fast forward to today, and the century ride remains a milestone for cyclists around the world. It’s more than just a badge of honor - it’s a love letter to the open road, a connection to the rich, sometimes bizarre history of the sport. And trust me, it’s one heck of a story to tell at the next gathering over coffee… or, you know, sports drinks."

The weather? Perfect. No wind, hardly any cars, and the bike felt like it was flying. Honestly, it was one of those rides where everything aligns… except for my overthinking brain, which stubbornly insisted on revisiting work worries instead of just enjoying the moment."

Even better, a friendly dog strolled over, and after a short “chat,” decided to sit and chill beside me. A true gentleman of the canine world."

The rolling hills there were a dream to ride through. As for the workout itself, I noticed I’ve improved at keeping a steady power output on climbs. All those short ascents in the 300–400-watt range felt surprisingly smooth. Progress feels good, even if it’s a bit nerdy to measure rides in watts."

I mean, except for the moments when I could only think about the cold.
